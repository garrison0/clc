  We are a congregation of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod. As Lutherans, we
  affirm the Nicene Creed which gives a summary of our beliefs. We seek to live
  out our faith through seeking to put Jesus' words found in Luke 10:27 into
  practice. "love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your
  strength, and all your mind. And, love your neighbor as yourself."  
pastoralCareDescription: "We all go through ups and downs. Sometimes life seems
  amazing, other times it's overwhelming. At Christ Church we have a team of
  people along with our pastor who offer care and support to help you face
  life's challenges and celebrate with you during life's joys, ultimately
  finding hope through Christ who sustains us through it all.  "
