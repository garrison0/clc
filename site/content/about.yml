  It is our Mission at Christ Church to "Celebrate and Share God's Gospel for
  the World throughout the World's Borough." As Church centered on Christ, and
  as a member of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod we are all about the Gospel,
  "the Good News" of God's redeeming love for the world in Christ Jesus' life,
  ministry, death on the cross, and resurrection from the dead, and the gift of
  God's Holy Spirit as we are brought to faith in Jesus through this powerful
  "Good News." As Jesus himself says in the Gospel According to Luke, the whole
  bible is centered on God's redemption that is accomplished in Jesus ("Was it
  not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his
  glory?‚Äù And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them
  in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself" Luke 24:26-27.) The Good
  News is at the center of what the whole of Scripture wants to teach about God.
  That means if we want to know what the bible is really about, we have to see
  Jesus at the center. 


  As Lutheran Christians, we emphasize that solely because of Jesus and all that he accomplished, we are "justified," or put into a right relationship with God. We are justified by faith in Christ Jesus apart from our works. Faith is not simply head knowledge but the trust and confidence of hearts, where we trust that God's love and forgiveness is not earned by our efforts, nor are we afraid of losing God's love due to our sins. Faith trusts in the "Good News" message that we are loved, forgiven, justified, redeemed, adopted and assured of eternal life in the hope of the resurrection with our Triune God through God's work centered on Jesus and experienced by His Holy Spirit. 


  In fact, to be justified, is more than just being in good relationship with God. It is to be made the family of God! This is why we celebrate at Christ Church. This redeeming and justifying love, where we enjoy our new life in the family of God is worth celebrating. So, we gather regularly in worship as this family. And that's what Church is. Church is being the family of God in Christ Jesus and also it is gathering together regularly to celebrate our life as God's family in Christ Jesus. Worship is like coming to a weekly family meal, where we receive the spiritual nourishment and love of our heavenly Father in Christ Jesus our Lord. In worship, we are constantly receiving the gifts of God's love and forgiveness in Jesus, who is present to serve us His divine grace. like a loving parent who always has a spot at the table to know you are loved and at home, in worship we gather at the call of our heavenly father and are fed and loved in Jesus and his Holy Spirit. As Lutheran Christians, we even call our worship, "The Divine Service," because we understand that in worship our loving God is serving us with the grace we need. In worship, with the historic liturgy of the church, we read the scriptures, hear the word preached, confess the historic catholic creeds (the Apostle's Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed) of the Christian Faith, receive Jesus' true body and blood in the sacrament of Communion and respond with our thanks and praise in the form of prayers and singing. Again, it's like the rhythm of coming home for the family meal, because we need to be fed with our life with God and it is God's good please to give us what we need so we never doubt who we are in Jesus. Because we have this new life in our faith, our Christian life is characterized by loving God and loving our neighbors, and as Jesus makes clear, our neighbors are absolutely everyone without exception. As Christians, we aren't perfect, we still sin and need to receive God's grace again and again, but through the gift of God's forgiveness and new life in Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit, we are learning to truly love God and others with true integrity as the fruit of our faith.


  Because we have received and experienced this Gospel Good News in Christ Jesus, through the Word of the Scriptures, in the promise of baptism and through being fed each week's Divine Service with Jesus' body and blood in communion, we at Christ Church want to share this Gospel Good News for the whole world by our words and deeds throughout all of the World's Borough--Queens, New York!  You always have a place in God's family Here at Christ Church and we are eager to share God's love with you! 


  ...If you want to know more about what it means to be a "Lutheran" Christian, you can see the collection of documents known as the Book of Concord, especially the Augsburg confession. Essentially though, "Lutherans" are not a different "church" but we are committed to the scriptural and apostolic faith of the historic "catholic" or universal Christian Church. However, "Lutherans" are Christians who are committed to always reforming the Church back to keeping the Gospel of God's grace in Christ Alone received through faith alone at the center, should it ever get sidetracked. We also believe that the Scriptures alone are sufficient for teaching who God, who we are as God's creation, and our life and salvation in God. We don't reject traditions in the church, but all traditions must flow from the bible and help us understand the bible and the gospel, otherwise they can be distracting or harmful to our Christian faith.
