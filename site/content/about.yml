  It is our Mission at Christ Church to "Celebrate and Share God's Gospel for
  the World throughout the World's Borough." As Church centered on Christ, and
  as a member of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod we are all about the Gospel,
  "the Good News" of God's redeeming love for the world in Christ Jesus' life,
  ministry, death on the cross, and resurrection from the dead, and the gift of
  God's Holy Spirit as we are brought to faith in Jesus through this powerful
  "Good News." As Jesus himself says in the Gospel According to Luke, the whole
  bible is centered on God's redemption that is accomplished in Jesus ("Was it
  not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his
  glory?‚Äù And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them
  in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself" Luke 24:26-27.) The Good
  News is at the center of what the whole of Scripture wants to teach about God.
  That means if we want to know what the bible is really about, we have to see
  Jesus at the center. 


  As Lutheran Christians, we emphasize that solely because of Jesus and all that he accomplished, we are "justified," or put into a right relationship with God. We are justified by faith in Christ Jesus apart from our works. Faith is not simply knowledge but trust and confidence, where we trust that God's love and forgiveness is not earned by our efforts, nor are we afraid of losing God's love due to our sins. Faith trusts in the "Good News" message that we are loved, forgiven, justified, and assured of eternal life and the hope of the resurrection with our Triune God through God's work centered on Jesus and experienced by His Holy Spirit. 


  In fact, to be justified, is more than just being in good relationship with God. It is to be made the family of God! This is why we celebrate at Christ Church. This redeeming and justifying love, where we enjoy our new life in the family of God is worth celebrating. So, we gather regularly in worship as this family. And that's what Church is. Church is being the family of God in Christ Jesus and also it is gathering together regularly to celebrate our life as God's family in Christ Jesus. Worship is like coming to a weekly family meal, where we receive the spiritual nourishment and love of our heavenly Father in Christ Jesus our Lord. In worship, we are constantly receiving the gifts of God's love and forgiveness in Jesus, who is present to serve us His divine grace. like a loving parent who always has a spot at the table to know you are loved and at home, in worship we gather at the call of our heavenly father and are fed and loved in Jesus and his Holy Spirit. As Lutheran Christians, we even call our worship, "The Divine Service," because we understand that in worship our loving God is serving us with the grace we need. In worship we read the scriptures, hear the word preached, receive Jesus' true body and blood in the sacrament of Communion and respond with our thanks and praise in the form of prayers and singing. Again, it's like the rhythm of coming home for the family meal, because we need to be fed with our life with God and it is God's good please to give us what we need so we never doubt who we are in Jesus. 


  Because we have received and experienced this Gospel Good News in Christ Jesus, through the Word of the scriptures, in the promise of baptism and through being fed each week's Divine Service with Jesus' body and blood in communion, we at Christ Church want to share this Gospel Good News for the whole world by our words and deeds throughout all of the World's Borough--Queens, New York!  You always have a place in God's family Here at Christ Church and we are eager to share God's love with you!
