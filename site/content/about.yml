  We are a congregation of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod. As Lutherans, we
  affirm the Nicene Creed which gives a summary of our beliefs. We seek to live
  out our faith through seeking to put Jesus' words found in Luke 10:27 into
  practice. "love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your
  strength, and all your mind. And, love your neighbor as yourself."
