  out our faith through seeking to put Jesus' words found in Luke 10:27 into

      When Pastor Alex isn't leading worship, preaching, counseling, leading bible studies, visiting with the people of Christ Church, getting to know the community, or studying early church history and the church fathers, you will mostly like find him spending time with his wife, playing jazz bass, reading in coffee shops around Queens, taking long walks while listening to audio books, going on dates with his wife to museums and jazz clubs, as well as finding fun bookstores and comic shops...not to mention, finding the best food spots around Queens!
