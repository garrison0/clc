  - title: Dinner and Discipleship
    email: >-
      Our lives as Christians are lives of discipleship. Being a disciple is
      more than an hour a week on Sundays but a whole life of being with and
      following Jesus. Because Jesus is our crucified and risen Lord, He is a
      living Lord and His presence is one to be enjoyed and experienced as we
      grow closer to Him through His word and His Spirit. 


      Dinner and Discipleship is a weekly gathering for the young adults of Christ Church to share a meal and learn more about living with Jesus every day of our lives as we grow more mature in our Christian life. If you are in your 20's or 30's and are eager to explore your discipleship with Jesus this is the place for you!

  - title: Women of Faith
    email: "Each month the women of Christ Church gather together for food and
      fellowship, Bible study, prayer and service projects. We are strengthened
      by a welcoming community of women of all ages as we share our own life
      journeys â€“ joys and struggles - and how God is leading us to greater trust
      and service. Come and be encouraged. Learn a new craft. Find nourishment
      and renewal. Enjoy coffee and conversation. Be inspired by the lives of
      women in the Bible as we explore what it means to love God with all our
      heart, soul, mind and strength.  "

      Our concern for our neighbors doesn't end at the borders of our
      neighborhood -

      it extends to the whole world. God embraces us with His love and calls us to embrace the world with that same engaging love. As a church, we strive to foster global awareness and concern - putting faith into action. Learning from our sisters and brothers in Christ throughout the world - we seek together to be Christ's hands and feet sharing the good news. 


      We are partnering in service and ministry with churches, pastors and missionaries

      in the Dominican Republic. Our upcoming servant trips will explore ways

      that we can strengthen our communities through support and understanding.
