  - title: Dinner and Discipleship
    description: >-
      Our lives as Christians are lives of discipleship. Being a disciple
      involves more than an hour a week on Sundays -- instead, it involves a
      whole life of following Jesus. Because Jesus is our crucified and risen
      Lord, He is a living Lord and His presence is one to be enjoyed and
      experienced as we grow closer to Him through His word and His Spirit. 


      Dinner and Discipleship is a weekly gathering for the young adults of Christ Church to share a meal and to learn more about living with Jesus every day of our lives. If you are in your 20's or 30's, and are eager to explore your discipleship with Jesus, this is the place for you!

  - title: Women of Faith
    description: >-
      Each month, the women of Christ Church gather together for food,
      fellowship, Bible study, prayer, and service projects. We are strengthened
      by a welcoming community of women of all ages as we share our own life
      journeys â€“ including its, joys, struggles, and evidence of how God is
      leading us to greater trust and service in Him. 


      Come and be encouraged. Learn a new craft. Find nourishment and renewal. Enjoy coffee and conversation. Be inspired by the lives of women in the Bible as we explore what it means to love God with all our heart, all our soul, all our mind, and all our strength.

      Our concern for our neighbors doesn't end at the borders of our
      neighborhood -

      it extends to the whole world. God embraces us with His love and calls us to embrace the world with that same engaging love. As a church, we strive to foster global awareness and concern -- to put faith into action. Learning from our sisters and brothers in Christ throughout the world, we seek together to be Christ's hands and feet, sharing the good news. 


      We are partnering in service and ministry with churches, pastors, and missionaries

      in the Dominican Republic. Our upcoming servant trips will explore ways

      that we can strengthen our respective communities through support and understanding.
